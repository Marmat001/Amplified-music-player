# Amplified React Music Player

This project is a React music player with expected functionality such as: Play / Pause, Forward / Back, drag handler to change position in any song. There is also a library with a selection of royalty free music that the user can browse through and play.

## About The Build

This application has really helped me with the concepts of: - Working with hooks such as useRef for capturing input values, - Passing, drilling and destructuring props, - Passing, lifting and modifying state... and more. Some of the features provided in this application are:

Play / pause
Skip Forward / back
View song length / time left
Drag handler to change position in current song
Song library to choose songs from
Mobile responsive
